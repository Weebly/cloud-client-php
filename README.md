# Weebly Cloud API Library: PHP

## Installation

### Composer

	composer require weebly/cloud-client

### Other
Download the latest release and include init.php in your code.

	require_once("path/to/cloud-client-php/src/init.php");

## Setup and Authentication
API calls are authenticated through a public key and a hash of your request and secret key. You can create and manage your API keys in the settings section of the Weebly Cloud Admin.

	WeeblyCloud\CloudClient::setKeys(YOUR_API_KEY, YOUR_API_SECRET);

You must set your public and secret key **before** making any calls to the API.

## Examples

#### Typical use case: create a user and site, get a login link

```php
// Get the admin account
try {
	$account = new WeeblyCloud\Account();
} catch (WeeblyCloud\Utils\CloudException $e) {
	print("Unable to get account.\n");
	print("Error code {$e->getCode()}: {$e->getMessage()}.\n");
	exit();
}

//Create a new user
try {
	$user = $account->createUser("test@domain.com");
} catch (WeeblyCloud\Utils\CloudException $e) {
	print("Unable to create user.\n");
	print("Error code {$e->getCode()}: {$e->getMessage()}.\n");
	exit();
}

//Store the user's ID
$user_id = $user->getProperty("user_id");

//Create a site
try {
	$site = $user->createSite("domain.com", ["site_title"=>"My Website"]);
} catch (WeeblyCloud\Utils\CloudException $e) {
	print("Unable to create site.\n");
	print("Error code {$e->getCode()}: {$e->getMessage()}.\n");
	exit();
}

//Store the site's ID
$site_id = $site->getProperty("site_id");

//Get and print a login link
try {
	print($site->loginLink());
} catch (WeeblyCloud\Utils\CloudException $e) {
	print("Unable to generate login link.\n");
	print("Error code {$e->getCode()}: {$e->getMessage()}.\n");
	exit();
}
```

#### Printing the name of all pages in a site matching the query "help"

```php
$pages = $site->listPages(["query"=>"help"]);
while ($page = $pages->next()) {
	print($page->getProperty("title")."\n");
}
```
or

```php
foreach ($site->listPages(["query"=>"help"]) as $page) {
	print($page->getProperty("title")."\n");
}

```

## Errors
If a request fails, the CloudClient throws a CloudException. A list of error codes can be found in the [API documentation](https://cloud-developer.weebly.com/about-the-rest-apis.html). The exception can be caught as folllows:

```php
# Create client
$client = WeeblyCloud\Utils\CloudClient::getClient();

try {
	$account = new WeeblyCloud\Account();
} catch (WeeblyCloud\Utils\CloudException $e) {
	print($e);
}
```

## Resources
The library provides classes that represent API resources. These resources can be **mutable**, meaning their properties can be changed, and **deletable**.

Common methods:

- The method **`$resource->getProperty($property)`** will return a given property of the resource. If the property does not exist, it will return **null**.
- The method **`$resource->setProperty($property, $value)`** will set the value of a given property of the resource. Changes will not be saved in the database until **`$resource->save()`** is called. If the resource is not mutable, calling this method will throw an exception. Not every property of a mutable resource can be changed; for more information, reference the [Cloud API Documentation](https://cloud-developer.weebly.com/about-the-rest-apis.html) for the resource in question's `PUT` method.
- The method **`$resource->save()`** saves the properties changed by setProperty() to the database. If the resource is not mutable, calling this method will throw an exception.
- The method **`$resource->delete()`** deletes the resource from the database. If the resource is not deletable, calling this method will throw an exception.

### Instantiating Resources
For example, to create an object representing a site with id `$site_id` and owned by `$user_id`:

	$site = new WeeblyCloud\Site($user_id, $site_id);

All resource constructors have two optional parameters, `initialize` (true by default) and `existing`. If `initialize` is set to false, the properties of the object are not retrieved from the database when the object is instantiated. Instead, `existing` is used to set the object's properties. This can be used to reduce unecessary API calls when chaining calls.

#### Examples

Retrieve all the sites of a user without getting that user's information:

	$sites = (new WeeblyCloud\User($user_id, false))->listSites();

Retrieve information about a site's store:

	$store = (new WeeblyCloud\Site($user_id, $site_id))->getStore();

Retrieve a list of products in the site's store:

    $site = new WeeblyCloud\Site($_ENV['USER_ID'], $_ENV['SITE_ID'], true);
    $store = $site->getStore;
	$products = $site->listProducts();
    // Get quantity of products in the store
    $numberOfProductsInStore = $site->getProductCount();
	while ($product = $products->next()) {
		print($product->getProperty("name")."\n");
	}


### Iterable Results
Methods beginning with `list` return a `CloudList`. Use the `next` function or a foreach loop to iterate through the list. For example:

```php
$sites = (new WeeblyCloud\User($user_id))->listSites();

while ($site = $sites->next()) {
	print($site->getProperty("site_title")."\n");
}
```
This would list the titles of all sites belonging to a given user.

## Making Raw API Calls
Not every resource has a cooresponding resource class. It is possible to make a raw API call using a `CloudClient` object.

```php
$client = WeeblyCloud\Utils\CloudClient::getClient();
```
Using that client, call `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, or `delete`. All client request methods take a url as their first argument. `post`, `patch`, and `put` take an optional hash map of data that will be sent in the request body. `get` takes an optional hash map whose values will be used in the query string of the request.

The url **must not** include a leading slash.

#### Request examples

##### Get cloud admin account account
```php
# Get client
$client = WeeblyCloud\Utils\CloudClient::getClient();

# Request the /account endpoint
$client->get("account");
```

##### Update a page title
```php
# Get client
$client = WeeblyCloud\Utils\CloudClient::getClient();

# Build endpoint with IDs
$endpoint = "user/{$user_id}/site/{$site_id}/page/{$page_id}";

# Make the request
$client->patch($endpoint, ["title"=>"New Title"]);
```

##### Get all sites for a user (with search parameters)
```php
# Get client
$client = WeeblyCloud\Utils\CloudClient::getClient();

# Build endpoint with IDs
$endpoint = "user/{$user_id}/site";

# Make the request (get all sites this user owns)
$client->get($endpoint, ["role"=>"owner"]);
```

### Handling Responses
All requests return a `CloudResponse` object or throw a CloudException. The JSON returned by the request can be accessed through the response's `body` property.

```php
# Make a request
$response = $client->get("account");

# Print JSON body of response
print($response->body);
```


### Pagination example
If the endpoint supports pagination, the next and previous pages of results can be retrieved with the `getPreviousPage()` and `getNextPage()` methods. If there is no next or previous page, those methods return null.

```php
# Create client
$client = WeeblyCloud\Utils\CloudClient::getClient();
$response = $client->get("user/{$user_id}/site",["limit"=>10]);

while($response){
	print($response->body . "\n");
	$response =  $response->getNextPage();
}
```
Get all of a user's sites, 10 sites per page.
